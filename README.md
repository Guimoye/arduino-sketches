# Arduino Sketches

Collection of Arduino sketches that I have created for my various [talks, workshops](sudarmuthu.com/my-talks), [blog posts](http://hardwarefun.com/tag/arduino) and also while generally playing around with Arduino and various shields.

## Sketches

This repo consists of the following sketches. I have tried to organize them into different groups.

### Basic Stuff

- Blink2 - Make a LED Blink
- DimingLed - Makes a LED to fade in and fade out. This sketch shows how you can use analogWrite function
- PushButtonControl - Basic push button
- PushButtonControl2 - Push button with sticky state

### Components/Sensors Specific
- SevenSegment - Shows how to use a seven segment display
- USBMouse - Sketches which shows how to interact with a USB Mouse

### Shield Specific

- BluetoothTest - Sketch to test Bluetooth Shield

### Connecting to Internet

- JsonParsing - Show how you can parse JSON using the aJson library. Code explanation is available at http://hardwarefun.com/tutorials/parsing-json-in-arduino
- YQL - Sketch that explains how to make calls to Yahoo Query Language and parse the results. Code explanation is available at http://hardwarefun.com/tutorials/accessing-yql-from-arduino

## Explanation

Explanation/documentation for some of these sketches can be found in my [HardwareFun](http://hardwarefun.com/) blog.

Some of the sketches are also used in the "[Building Robots using Arduino](http://hardwarefun.com/tutorials/building-robots-using-arduino)" tutorial series.
